        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This tastes just like the cole slaw served at popular fried chicken 
            or fish restaurants. It's excellent with burgers or on top of BBQ'd 
            pork sandwiches, too!!! </p>
    
            <p>This was great! I used mayo instead of miracle whip and rice wine vinegar instead 
            of white vinegar, but just barely cut back on the sugar because rice vinegar is 
            slightly sweet. My friends agreed that it was even better than the slaw at the 
            great BBQ place in town. Will definitely make again!</p>
